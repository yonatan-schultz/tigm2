"The Long War" : 'Play a longer game by using the optional side of the Victory Point Track, which goes to 14 victory points rather than 10. <br /></br > In addition, when preparing the Public Objective Deck, randomly select 5 Stage II Public Objective Cards (instead of 3) in addition to the “Game Over Card”, and 8 Stage I Public Objective Cards (instead of 6), creating a Public Objective Deck of 14 cards (instead of 10).'
"Age Of Empire" : "After creating the Public Objective Deck as normal, start to draw its cards, starting from the top. After drawing a card, place it face up in the common play area, creating a straight line of cards starting to the left. After drawing and placing the “Game Over” card, if there are any additional cards remaining in the deck, place those cards back in the box (you will not need them). Now you should have a line of Public Objective Cards somewhere between 7 and 10 cards long with the “Game Over” card in the rightmost position. <br /><br />During the game, players may qualify for the victory points of any of the revealed Objective Cards from Turn one. No further Public Objective Cards will enter the game. In this way, players know exactly which objectives will give them victory points for the duration of the game. <br /><br />After the end of the Status Phase of the first game round, place a Turn token (a glass bead, a thimble, a quarter, etc.) on the leftmost card. After every Status Phase is finished, move the Turn token one card to the right. When the Turn token moves onto the Game Over card, the game ends immediately, and the player with the highest number of victory points is the winner (as described in the core rules). In this way, your row of Objective Cards also act as a Turn track."
"Distant Suns" : "Included in the game, you will find the octagon-shaped “Domain” counters that form the core of the “Distant Suns” game option. Using Domain Counters dramatically alters the strategy and flavor during the early turns of TI, as they simulate the dangers and rewards of space exploration and colonization.<br /><br />After the game board has been created, but before the game begins, randomize the Domain Counters and place one Domain Counter face down on every neutral planet on the board (do not place Domain Counters on any Home System planets or on Mecatol Rex). Place excess Domain Counters back in the box without looking at them."
"Leaders" : "Included in the game, you will find 30 Leader counters (3 for each race). These represent exceptional personalities that will assist their race in its struggle to attain the imperial throne."
"Sabotage Runs" : "Although the mighty War Sun unit is the undisputed king of space, history has shown that such hubris of creation often hides a fatal flaw that can be exploited by the smallest of spacecraft.<br /><br />When using this game option, Fighter units have a desperate chance of a pre-Space Battle strike at an enemy War Sun in the contested system. This desperate attack is called the “sabotage run.”"
"Race-Specific Technologies" : "Players who want more diverse abilities for the races may enjoy this option. Each race has one Race-Specific Technology Card that may be purchased instead of a regular Technology Card. Whenever you are entitled to purchase a Technology, you may purchase your race-specific Technology instead. The cost of a Race-Specific Technology is whatever you would pay for a regular Technology at the time plus the cost on the race-specific Technology card."
"Artifacts" : "When playing with the Artifacts option, include the 4 Special Objective cards that have pictures of artifacts on their fronts.<br /></br >As described on the 4 “artifact” Special Objective cards, artifacts are worth 1 Victory Point to the player that controls the planet that the artifact is on. Artifacts may never be moved or destroyed."
"Shock Troops" : "As the Twilight Wars progressed and warriors proved themselves in battle, a new classification of Ground Forces known as Shock Troops arose. Shock Troops are elite, experienced troopers that make very formidable opponents."
"Space Mines" : "Later in the war, it became clear that PDS cannons were not enough to defend the core systems. Space mines – homing explosives that lock on to capital ships’ registration signals and attempt to detonate enemy targets – were developed to supplement other defenses."
"The Wormhole Nexus" : "The Wormhole Nexus tile represents a unique system outside the known galaxy. This tile is placed off the board, and a player may travel to it by using either an Alpha or a Beta Wormhole. Players always have a choice as to whether they want to travel to the Wormhole Nexus or another end of a matching Wormhole whenever they use a Wormhole.<br /><br />The Wormhole Nexus is treated like any other system, but is considered adjacent to every system that con- tains an Alpha or Beta Wormhole."
"Facilities" : "Players who prefer games with more abundant resources may wish to use this option. This expansion includes 16 Facility Cards: 8 colonies and 8 refineries. These facilities may be built on any planet outside of a player’s Home System at the cost of 1 resource. Facilities add 1 additional resource or influence to the planet they are built on.<br /><br />Colonies increase the influence value of a planet by 1, while refineries increase the resource value of a planet by 1."
"Tactical Retreats" : "With this option, add the following rule regarding retreats:<br /><br />“When announcing a retreat, the defender may use a Command Counter from his Strategy Allocation area to activate an adjacent, unactivated system that he controls (or that is empty). At the end of the combat round, he must retreat to this system. Players may also still attempt normal retreats.”"
"Territorial Distant-Suns" : "This option keeps all the excitement of Distant Suns while reducing the risk of early expansion. Lower risk domain counters are placed near home systems while higher risk counters are reserved for systems nearer to Mecatol Rex."
"Custodians of Mecatol Rex" : "Using this option, a single Ground Force can no longer invade Mecatol Rex on a whim. Now the Winnaran custodians will protect the capital with strength and fortitude.<br /><br />When using this variant, place both of the Mecatol Rex Custodian tokens on Mecatol Rex during setup. The Mecatol Rex Custodians have 2 Ground Forces and 3 Fighters that will protect the planet from invading players."
"Voice of the Council" : "Players who wish to add to the usefulness of influence and Political Cards may wish to use the included Voice of the Council Special Objective Card. This Special Objective works as follows.<br /><br />Before activating the primary ability of the Political Strategy Card or the Assembly Strategy Card, the active player may call for a vote to determine who becomes Voice of the Council. All players then vote for any player (as if they were voting on an agenda). The player that receives the most votes (ties being broken by the Speaker) gains control of the Voice of the Council Objective (placing it in front of him). He immediately gains 1 Victory Point, and the previous owner of the Objective loses 1 Victory Point."
"Simulated Early Turns" : "This option is for players who wish to speed up the early game. Using this option, players can quickly decide where they wish to expand early in the game."
"Preliminary Objectives" : "To play with the Preliminary Objectives, simply deal one to each player during setup (instead of the usual Secret Objective) and return the rest of the Preliminary Objectives to the box, without looking at them. Preliminary Objective Cards are not shuffled into the existing Secret Objective deck."
"Flagships" : "This option gives players the ability to build their race’s Flagship, a powerful unit with unique special abilities for each race."
"The Final Frontier" : "This expansion includes octagon-shaped Domain Counters similar to those used in the “Distant Suns” game option. The Space Domain Counters have a different back than previous Domain Counters (an image of empty space rather than a planet). Using these Space Domain Counters, players will experience more surprises and uncertainty when entering empty systems."
"Mechanized Units" : "This option provides new units that function much like Ground Forces but provide much more firepower and survivability."
"Mercenaries" : "Players may hire Mercenaries when executing the primary ability of the Trade III Strategy Card. To play with the Mercenaries option, simply use the new Trade III Strategy Card in place of the Trade or Trade II Strategy Cards."
"Political Intrigue" : "Players who want a more robust political system may wish to use this option. During setup, each player receives his race’s three Representative Cards, and the five Promissory Note Cards matching his color. Players use these cards to represent their race in the Galactic Council and to create binding contracts."
